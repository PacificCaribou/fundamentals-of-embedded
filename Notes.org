* Fundamentals of Embedded Notes
** Learning Goals
   You will learn to design embedded systems front to back on your own at a
   high level.
** Sessions
** Scaffold
   A preview of what's to come. Content is deleted as I progress
   through each section.

   - introduction
   - precision, accuracy, measurement uncertainty
     - sources of noise
     - how noise affects computation
     - propogating uncertainties
       - deriving Uncertainty Propogation Approximation
   - C programming for embedded systems
     - minimal C program examples
     - what goes on? what happens during eventual execution?
